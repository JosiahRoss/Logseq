	 - Today will be great if I can... keep this shoot on target for time , it will be hard but i think we can pull it off, it will take [[Kara Tansel]] being able to  tell the client when good enough is enough,

	 - [[Nikki Masset]] woke up early and is in a pretty good mood , and she will have a good day

	 - [[Train]] 
		 - I am writing this on the train , just like the tag says, i guess i am just trying to use the time i have, and i never know what to do on the train anyway, this will let me do a bit of reflextion  before going in to work , it also wont allow me to give any other reason for not doing some writing everyday 

		 - I am never sure how useful this type of practice is for me, i think the people who normally use this in there life have a goal in mind with writing not just a vague idea that it is imortant to write everyday

		 - I do hope that i can use this as practice for keeping my emails friendly and professional this is where i fall off, 

		 - last night got strange, sex with Nikki was almost sad, she jus laid there barely enjoying herself, her reason for feeelling that way was that i dont get reaging errecgtion when we make out anymore, i think it is most likly a health issue she think that i dont find her atractive, ii understand why she feels like that some time, when we were haveing sex, all i could think was "what am i doing wrong 

		 - i need to start working out proper no more fucking around,  I will be joining a gym near work so i can go before or after , i know that it will not be that hard, and it wont even take that long ,  i set up a todo to go running , i need to do laundry so i have what i need for running , so i dont have a ecuse cause i will use whatever i can  to not feel like a fat piece of shit winded and dieing , 

	 - **Gratitudes**
