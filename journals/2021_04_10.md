- today i really havent done anything that great , but the new keyboard came in and it is great m, i really enjoy it i like the feel and i like it better than  the key board i have at work less pressure needed , and it is so much smaller i love it 

- I am trying to use the keyboard in the oculus , it is a bit nuts but kinda fun 
	 - i cant imagine , doing this in any real way but in some years this will be the the way to use a computer it works well and after the laytency issues of our modern internet 

- i need to get my shit together when it comes to , well really everything , i am super focused on work , sorta , i have lost the momentium i had a month ago , and that is silly i need to continue doing what i can to make sure that i keep learning and improving my shit
