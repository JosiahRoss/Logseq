				 - = and whatever the fomula is goes to the right of the equl sign

			 - [[Topic 9]]: [[Sharing]]
				 - To share **individual items** one at a time with **a few people,** follow the sharing steps in this article. (To share an individual item that is stored in a workspace, see the [share an item from a workspace](https://help.smartsheet.com/learning-track/get-started/sharing#Workspace_Sharing) section of this article.)

				 - When a sheet, report, or dashboard exists in a workspace, it will be available to anyone who has sharing permissions for the workspace. Even when it's in a workspace, the item can be shared at the item level so that people who don't have access to the workspace can still have access to the item.

				 - You must have **Owner, Admin, **or **Editor - can share **permissions to the item in order to share it. Similarly, to share a workspace, you'll need **Owner, Admin, **or** Editor - can share** permission to the workspace.

				 - NOTE: Only **Owners **and **Admins **can share dashboards.

				 - Here's how you can give someone access to an item that's located in a workspace:
					 - **Browse **to the Workspace where the item you want to share is located.

					 - In the top right corner of the item, click **Share**.

					 - Click in the **Invite Collaborators** box and type or select contacts.

					 - At the bottom of the form, you'll see **This sheet, report, or dashboard is in a workspace**. If you have permissions to access the workspace, you'll also see the name of the workspace.

					 - To share the item only, click **Share. **To share the workspace, click **Share Workspace.**

				 - When items and workspaces are shared, you'll see the **Shared to Sheet, Report, or dashboard via workspace** icon and/or the **Shared to Sheet, Report, or dashboard only** icon next to the permission levels in the **Collaborators **section of the sharing form. These icons show how the item has been shared with the various collaborators.

				 - To set a default view on your sheet:
					 - In the top right corner of the item, click **Share**.

					 - Select **Collaborators** to display the list of current Smartsheet users shared on the sheet.

					 - To the right of **Default View**, select **Edit**. The** Default View** form appears.

					 - Under **View,** select **Grid View, Card View, Gantt View,** or **Calendar View.** You can also select a default filter and specific Card View lanes.

					 - NOTE: You'll need to create a **__shared__** filter before you can set a default filter. For more information about creating filters, see our article on [Using Filters to Show or Hide Sheet Data](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504659).

					 - 

					 - Click **Save**.

					 - You can ensure that a collaborator is looking at an item with the same view and filters applied by sending them the URL from the address bar of your browser. ([Learn more about views.](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/765715))

					 - NOTE: Default View settings don't apply to the Mobile App. Users accessing a sheet from the App will be defaulted to Grid View.

				 - More Sharing Options
					 - If you want to collaborate or share data without sharing people directly to your Smartsheet items, you can use any of the following options:
						 - **Publish: **If you want to share Smartsheet items with people who don’t have Smartsheet accounts, you can send them a publish link. Published Smartsheet items are dynamic, so the data is always up to date. See [Publish a Sheet, Report, or Dashboard](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/522078) for more information about publishing.

						 - **Send as Attachment: **If you want to share a static Excel or PDF file of a Smartsheet item, you can email it as an attachment using the Send as Attachment feature. You can also email specific row data to other people which can be useful if they want information about a specific task or group of rows in a large sheet. To learn more, see [Share Sheet Information in Email](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504773).

						 - **Use a Form: **If you want to collect information from people, use a form. Forms allow people to add new rows to your sheet based on their form submissions without direct sharing access. For more information, see [Collect Information with a Form](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/522221).

						 - **Use Automated Workflows: **If you need to share specific data to automatically notify people of changes to your sheets, send reminders for due dates, or request automatic updates or approvals, use automated workflows. Information about automated workflows can be found in [Save Time and Work Faster With Automated Workflows](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2476191).

				 - Share an Item from a Workspace
					 - When a sheet, report, or dashboard exists in a workspace, it will be available to anyone who has sharing permissions for the workspace. Even when it's in a workspace, the item can be shared at the item level so that people who don't have access to the workspace can still have access to the item.

					 - You must have **Owner, Admin, **or **Editor - can share **permissions to the item in order to share it. Similarly, to share a workspace, you'll need **Owner, Admin, **or** Editor - can share** permission to the workspace.

					 - NOTE: Only **Owners **and **Admins **can share dashboards.

					 - Here's how you can give someone access to an item that's located in a workspace:
						 - **Browse **to the Workspace where the item you want to share is located.

						 - In the top right corner of the item, click **Share**.

						 - Click in the **Invite Collaborators** box and type or select contacts.

						 - At the bottom of the form, you'll see **This sheet, report, or dashboard is in a workspace**. If you have permissions to access the workspace, you'll also see the name of the workspace.

						 - To share the item only, click **Share. **To share the workspace, click **Share Workspace.**

					 - When items and workspaces are shared, you'll see the **Shared to Sheet, Report, or dashboard via workspace** icon and/or the **Shared to Sheet, Report, or dashboard only** icon next to the permission levels in the **Collaborators **section of the sharing form. These icons show how the item has been shared with the various collaborators.

				 - Request Access From Owner
					 - In some cases, you may attempt to open an item and will see a message similar to the following: "The item is not currently available - it may have been deleted or your permission may have been removed from it.."

					 - Common reasons for this message include:
						 - A sharing link was forwarded to you but your email address isn't shared to the item

						 - You're logged into Smartsheet with an email address that is different from the one the email was sent to

						 - The item owner or another collaborator has removed you from sharing

						 - The item has since been deleted

					 - If you'd like to access a sheet, report, dashboard, or workspace that isn't shared to your email address, click **Request Access From Owner**. This sends email to the owner with a link they can click to [select a sharing permission level](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/1155182). Once the item or workspace owner has completed this process you’ll be able to access the item.

			 - [[Topic 10]]: [[Contacts]]
				 - Before You Begin: Format Your .CSV File
					 - The total number of contacts allowed is unlimited. However, you can import **only 1,000 contacts** at a time.

					 - If you want to import contacts from Outlook, Hotmail, or AOL, you must first export the contacts to a .csv file. The columns in the .csv file __must be named__ **First Name, Last Name,** and **Email Address,** respectively. Exact spelling is important or the list won't import correctly.

					 - Here's an example of how to format your .csv file:

				 - Add Contacts to My Smartsheet Contacts
					 - Bulk Import Contacts
						 - Click **Account** > **My Smartsheet Contacts**.

						 - The **My Smartsheet Contacts** form appears.

						 - 

						 - Click **Import Contacts,** and then select **Gmail, .csv (Outlook, Yahoo, etc.), **or **vcf (vCard File).**

						 - Follow the step appropriate for the type of contact that you want to import:

						 - **Gmail**

						 - Select which contacts you want to import into Smartsheet and then click **Import**.

						 - You may be prompted for your email username and password. After you enter this information, click **Sign In.**

						 - NOTE: Smartsheet does not store your email username or password; those credentials are used only to access your email address book.

						 - **.csv (Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)**

						 - Select the .csv file, and click **Continue**. Choose which contacts you want to import into Smartsheet and then click **Import**.

						 - **.vcf (vCard File)**

						 - Select the vCard file, click **Continue, **and then click **Import**.

						 - The contacts are added to your My Smartsheet Contact List.

					 - Add Contacts Individually
						 - Click **Account** > **My Smartsheet Contacts**.

						 - In the My Smartsheet Contacts form, click **Add **to display the Contact window****.****

						 - Type the name and email address of the contact and click **OK**.

						 - The new contact is added to your list of contacts.

					 - Add Individual Contacts When You Share a Smartsheet Item
						 - When you share items in Smartsheet by typing an email address, the email address may be added to your My Smartsheet Contacts list automatically. To associate a name with the address, follow the steps in this article to [edit the contact](https://help.smartsheet.com/learning-track/get-started/contacts#editcontact).

						 - -or-

						 - Click the collaborator icon ![](https://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/attachments/293948) next to the **Invite Collaborators** field to display your current Smartsheet Contact list. Click **Add New** in the lower-left corner of the window to add a contact to the list.

				 - Edit or Delete Contacts
					 - Click **Account **> **My Smartsheet Contacts**.

					 - The **My Smartsheet Contacts** form appears.

					 - 

					 - Right-click the contact that you want to edit or delete and select **Edit Contact** or **Delete Contact**.

					 - NOTE: Deleting or editing a contact in your contact list doesn't remove or update the email address on shared sheets or update any task assignments. For information about removing a collaborator from sharing sheets, see[ Sharing Sheets](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/520104#remove). To re-assign tasks, see the article on [Find & Replace](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2115655).

				 - Export Contacts from Your Smartsheet Contacts List
					 - Click **Account** > **My Smartsheet Contacts**.

					 - The **My Smartsheet Contacts** form appears.

					 - 

					 - Click **Export Contacts** > **.csv.**

					 - The contacts from your My Smartsheet Contacts list will be exported as a .csv file to the location where downloads are stored on your computer.

				 - Tips and Best Practices for Using Contacts
					 - Here are some things to keep in mind when working with contacts:
						 - You may not see all of your contacts when you click in a Contact List column. Here's what you will see: (1) contacts that have already been used in the sheet and (2) names of collaborators who have been shared to the sheet.

						 - To use contacts from your entire Smartsheet contact list, start typing your contact's name into a cell in the Contact  List column and relevant results will appear via auto-resolve. Currently, there isn't a way to use contact list entries from other sheets.

						 - The names you select for your contacts will appear when you assign tasks to them in Contact List columns. However, in other areas such as the **Sharing** list, the name displayed will be pulled from the user's Smartsheet account. (You can change the name used with your Smartsheet account via Personal Settings: click **Account** > **Personal Settings**).

						 - Group Admins on Business and Enterprise plans can organize contacts into groups, making it easier to share and send information to multiple people. For more information, see [Managing Groups.](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/1554165)

						 - You can import **only 1,000 contacts** at a time.

					 - [{:tag :h2}HELP ARTICLES{:tag :h3}Contacts and Groups Help ArticlesLearn about contacts and contact groups in Smartsheet.](https://help.smartsheet.com/topics/Sharing%20and%20Collaboration#toc--contacts-and-contact-groups-)

			 - [[Topic 11]] : [[Groups]]
				 - Group Management enables a Group Admin to organize contacts into groups so that anyone using a Business or Enterprise plan can quickly share and send information to all of the people in the group.

				 - You must be designated as a Group Admin on a Business or Enterprise plan to create and manage groups. Once a group is set up, anyone on the Business or Enterprise plan will be able to share and send information to that group.

				 - Create a Group
					 - Click **Account** > **Account Admin** > **Group Management** (or [click here](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=axFO9VtvnK66IVWeeBXnOQ)).

					 - The **Group Management** form appears, listing all existing groups.

					 - 

					 - Click the **Create a Group** button to display the **New Group** form.

					 - Name your group (for example: Sales Team) and give it a description.

					 - Click **Create**.

					 - A form will appear listing all current group members. By default, only your email address will be included.

					 - 

					 - To add members to the group, click the **Add to Group** button.

					 - Begin typing in the name or email address of a contact in your Smartsheet Contacts list and they will appear in the drop-down list via auto-resolve.

					 - You can add any contact you like—a contact doesn't have to be part of your Business or Enterprise plan or even a current Smartsheet user.

					 - The **Add To Group** form will be updated to show the list of contacts that you selected in the previous step. Click **Save** to complete the addition of the users to the group.

					 - When you're finished adding to the group, click **Save**.

					 - For more information about working with Smartsheet contacts, see [create new contacts ](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/796143-managing-contacts)that you can then add to the group.

				 - Manage an Existing Group
					 - A group can be managed by its owner or by any System Admin on the account.
						 - Click **Account** > **Account Admin** > **Group Management** (or [click here](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=axFO9VtvnK66IVWeeBXnOQ)) to display a list of existing groups created by Group Admins.

						 - To make changes to the group, click the drop-down arrow ![](https://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/attachments/83367) to the left of the group name.

					 - Here are descriptions of the available options.

					 - **Edit Group**: Displays a list of members currently in the group. Here's what you can do when you choose this option:
						 - Add members to the group: Click the **Add to Group** button to select contacts from your Smartsheet Contact list to include in the group. This will also add them to all sheets shared to the group.

						 - Remove members from the group: click on the name(s)  of the member(s) you'd like to remove, then click **Remove from Group**. This will also remove the member from sheets that are shared to the group.

						 - Edit group name and description: Click the **Edit** link next to the group's name.

					 - **System Admins Only—Download Group Sheet Access Report (csv)**: Downloads a file to your computer listing the name of each sheet that is shared to the selected group. The file also includes the sheet owner's name, group's permission level to the sheet and the date of the sheet's last modification.

					 - NOTE: This option is available to System Admins only. For more information on the different user types in Smartsheet, see [Account-Level User Types for Business and Enterprise Plans](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/520100).

					 - **Transfer Group Ownership**: Transfers ownership of the group to another **Group Admin** on the Business or Enterprise account.

					 - **Delete Group**: Deletes the group from the list. This will also remove the group from any sheets it it currently shared to and any recurring emails that are being sent to its members. This action can't be undone so proceed with caution.

				 - Use a Group to Send or Share Information
					 - Once a group is set up in Smartsheet, anyone on the the Business or Enterprise plan can use the group name to send information to or share items with that group.

					 - Send Information to a Group via Email
						 - You can use the Send feature to send email to an entire group (for more specific information about sharing Smartsheet information in email, see [Share Sheet Information in Email](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504773)).

						 - To send to the group, in the **To** box, begin typing the name of the group to see it appear in the drop-down list.

					 - Share a Smartsheet Item with a Group
						 - To share a Smartsheet item (sheet, report, or dashboard) with a group:
							 - Click the **Share** button in the upper-right corner of the Smartsheet window.

							 - In the Sheet Sharing form, in the **Invite Collaborators** box, type the group name (or click **Select Contacts**  ![](https://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/attachments/293948) to select the group name from your list of contacts).

							 - You'll be prompted to select a sharing permission level. This permission level will apply to all members in the group.

							 - Once the sheet is shared to the group, you'll see group name included in the list of people who are shared to the sheet. (You can see this at any time by clicking the **Share** button in the upper-right corner of the Smartsheet window.)

							 - Here are some things to keep in mind when you share with a group:
								 - When someone is shared to a sheet as part of a group, they can't be removed from the sheet without removing the entire group.

								 - Anyone on the same Smartsheet plan as the group can click the group name and select **View Group Members** to reveal the email addresses and names of its members. Anyone not on the Smartsheet plan will only be able to see the group name, unless they are a member of the external group.

								 - Note: Users who are not members of the organization will not be able to share a sheet with a group, and the dropdown arrow won’t be displayed at this point.

								 - If you send a sheet or row to a group you're part of, you won't receive the email, but everyone else in the group will. Check the **Cc Me** box at the bottom of the window to receive a copy of the email.

								 - If a collaborator is shared to a sheet both as part of a group and individually, the highest permission level will be applied to their account. For example, if User A's group is shared to a sheet with Editor permission and the sheet was also shared to User A's individual email address with Admin permission, User A will be able to access the sheet as an Admin while the rest of the group will have only Editor-level permissions.

								 - If you don't want to share with an entire group, you can the drop-down arrow ![](https://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/attachments/83367) next to the group's name and click **Expand. **When you do this, you'll replace the group name with the email addresses of the group's members. You can remove individuals as needed. Once you do this, the sheet will be shared to the individuals, NOT the group; so, adding or removing users from the group won't have any impact on sharing to that sheet.

			 - [[Topic 12]] : [[Card View]]
				 - Card View is one of the four ways to view your sheet in Smartsheet and helps your team to see, share, and act on projects together with drag-and-drop cards so you can more easily prioritize and organize work. Card View comes out of agile project management methodology, but it can provide any team with a more visual way to communicate and collaborate in Smartsheet.

				 - Since Card View is about prioritization and organization, it is driven by the drop-down list, symbol, and contact list column types that offer multiple selections. These different selection options create the lanes in which to drop your cards.

				 - **Card View: Create, Edit, and Share Cards**
					 - In **Card View, **cards make up the work items or tasks in your project. [Field values](https://help.smartsheet.com/learning-track/get-started/card-view#fields) on the cards display information about the task. A card can display a total of 10 fields: the title field and up to 9 additional fields.

					 - ![Card in Smartsheet Card View](https://help.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Card_Callouts-634616.png)
						 - The title of a card will always be the field value for the sheet’s **Primary Column**. Check out the Help Center article on the [Primary Column](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504645) for more information.

						 - Fields on the card display information about the task.

						 - **Attachments** and **Comments** icons will be displayed if the task includes these items.

						 - The Reminders icon will be displayed if you’ve set reminders for the task.

				 - Create a New Card
					 - To add a new task or item (a card) to your project:
						 - In the lane that you want to add the card to, do either of the following:

						 - At the end of the list of cards, click the **Add Card **icon**.**

						 - ![Add Card](https://help.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Fast-Add-Card.png)

						 - -or-

						 - Right-click a card and click **Insert Above** or **Insert Below. **

						 - The **Edit **form will be displayed for you to fill in.

						 - 

						 - In the **Edit **form, fill in the details and click **OK.**

				 - Edit a Card
					 - Add Data to a Card
						 - To edit or add data to a card, double-click it to open the **Edit** form.

						 - Make the desired changes and click **OK.**

						 - To **insert** an image, **clear** the contents of a field, or add a **hyperlink**, click the arrow next to the name of the field that you want to edit.

					 - Change the Color Bar for a Card
						 - There are two options for changing the color that appears on the outer edge of a card: you can change the color manually or you can change it automatically with a conditional formatting rule.

						 - To change the color manually:
							 - Right-click the edge of the card.

							 - Select a color.

							 - ![Change Color Bar](https://help.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Change_Color_Bar.png)

							 - 

						 - If you have Admin- or Owner-level sharing permissions to the sheet, you can change the color via conditional formatting by clicking the **Conditional Formatting ![Conditional Formatting button](https://help.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/conditional-formatting-button.png)** icon in the toolbar and creating a rule.

						 - For more information about conditional formatting, see the [Conditional Formatting](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/516359) article.

				 - Share a Card Via Email or Request an Update
					 - To share the contents of a card or to request input from others, right-click the card and click **Send **or **Send Update Request** to open the **Send** or **Send Update Request** form.

					 - By default, information from all available columns in the sheet (including Attachments and Comments) will be sent. That is, the information sent won’t be limited to the fields displayed on the card. To exclude columns, click the **Edit **button and uncheck any column name that you want to omit from the email.

					 - For more information, see [Sending Sheets & Rows Via Email](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504773) and [Using Update Requests.](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2449494-card-view-creating-editing-and-sharing-cards)

				 - Work with Fields
					 - Cards display the data that’s captured in **fields **(in Grid View, this data is displayed in cells on the sheet). Each card will always display a title—the value for the title will always be the value of the Primary Column.

					 - Change Which Fields Appear in Your Cards (Admin Permissions Required)
						 - A card can display a total of 10 fields: the title, plus up to 9 additional fields. If you have Admin permissions to the sheet, you can change which fields are displayed:
							 - Click **Card View Settings** (the gear icon) in the upper-right corner of Smartsheet.

							 - Check or uncheck field names.

						 - In Grid View, you can create visual hierarchy in a sheet by indenting to create parent and child rows. Details on this are available in the Help Center article on [Hierarchy](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504734). After creating hierarchical relationships, you can display the parent of a task on a card in Card View by selecting the **(Title of Parent) **field.

					 - Add a New Field
						 - Click **Card View Settings** (the gear icon) in the upper-right corner of Smartsheet.

						 - Click **Add New.**

						 - When you add a new field in Card View, a new column of the same name will be added to Grid View. For example, if you add a checkbox field in Card View named Done, a column named Done (with a Checkbox column type) will be added as the rightmost column in Grid View.

					 - Edit the Properties of an Existing Field
						 - To edit the properties of an existing field—for example to change the type or the label—you’ll need to switch to Grid View (click Grid View in the left toolbar) and edit the column properties from there. For more information, see [Insert, Delete, or Rename Columns.](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504616)

			 - [[Topic 13]] : [[Basic Gantt View]]
				 - Gantt View is one of the four ways to view your sheet in Smartsheet and offers a visual timeline of your work. Gantt charts are a staple in traditional waterfall project management but can be used anytime you want a visual representation of your schedule and the relationships between tasks.

				 - In order to use Gantt View, you must have at least two Date columns in your sheet: a start date and an end date.

				 - **Create and Work With a Gantt Chart**
					 - Display tasks in your sheets and reports as bars in a timeline with a Gantt chart. Get a picture of the duration, as well as the start and finish date of your project's tasks Gantt View.

					 - You can view any sheet or report that contains at least __two__ date columns in Gantt View. (For more information on Date columns, see the [Column Types](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504619#date) article in the Help Center.)

					 - ![cropped-gantt](https://help.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/cropped-gantt.png)

					 - A Gantt chart also allows you to do the following:
						 - See [dependencies](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/765727) and track the relationship between tasks

						 - View the [critical path](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/1979152) of your project

						 - Display the [% complete](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/765737) of your tasks

						 - Use [hierarchy](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504734) to create summary rows for further organization of your projects

				 - Add a Gantt Chart
					 - You can add a Gantt chart to any existing sheet and optionally enable the dependencies features to create automation between project sheet columns.

					 - To add a Gantt chart:
						 - Ensure your sheet contains at least two date columns, one representing the Start date of tasks and one representing the End date.

						 - These columns are required to add a Gantt chart to the sheet because the length of each task bar is based on the span of time between the given dates.

						 - 

						 - Select the **Gantt View **button in the toolbar to display your tasks in a timeline view based on their Start and Finish dates.

						 - ![Views on the toolbar](https://help.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/views.png)

						 - The chart will appear to the right of your columns and a divider splits the screen between grid columns and the Gantt chart. You can drag this divider right or left to widen the display of either section.

						 - 

						 - Click the gear icon to open **Project Settings** and make sure your Gantt chart is using the correct columns for start and end date.

					 - Adjust the Timeline Display
						 - Across the top of the Gantt chart, an adjustable **Primary **and **Secondary Timeline** allows you to display your tasks using different units of time.

						 - ![zoom](https://help.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/zoom.png)

						 - Click **Zoom In** or **Zoom Out** to toggle the different timeline displays.

					 - Adjust the Project Settings
						 - Click the gear icon to access the Project Settings for the sheet.

						 - In the Project Settings form, you can:
							 - Enable Dependencies for automatic task duration calculation

							 - Adjust the **Primary** and **Secondary** **Timeline Displays**

							 - Configure non-working days and holidays

						 - Find out more about modifying project settings in the [Modify Project Settings](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/765755) article.

						 - If you've configured a **% Complete** column in Project Settings, any time a value is entered in this column its also visually indicated in the Gantt bar for the task:

						 - ![](https://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/attachments/486081)

					 - Display Hierarchy
						 - In the sheet's Primary Column, you can indent rows to create a hierarchical relationship to organize rows into sections that you can expand or collapse. Child rows display as individual task bars in the Gantt chart based on their start and end dates.

						 - If dependencies are enabled on the sheet, parent rows reflect a summary of their child rows. The parent row values are calculated automatically in the duration, start and end date, and % complete columns and can't be modified. If dependencies aren't enabled, you can change the parent row information as needed.

						 - NOTE: Row hierarchy isn't displayed in a report.

					 - Apply Color to the Gantt Bars
						 - Change the color of a Gantt bar color in a sheet by right-clicking on the bar and selecting **Color Settings**.

						 - NOTE: Task bar colors may change automatically if your sheet has Conditional Formatting rules set up. Check out our Help Center article on [Conditional Formatting](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/516359) for more information.

					 - The Gantt chart has 4 timeline zoom levels: quarter, month, week and day. Anyone with access to the sheet can quickly change the timeline zoom level by clicking the **Zoom In** or **Zoom Out** icons in the Gantt Chart header:

					 - ![](https://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/attachments/83300)

					 - While anyone can use the **Zoom in/out** icons to adjust their own view, changes made by Viewers and Editors won't affect other collaborators or be displayed in an [export](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/770623). Only the sheet owner and collaborators with Admin access can make changes to the exported timeline.

					 - NOTE: In the Gantt chart of a Report, all collaborators except Viewers are able to save changes to the Gantt chart timeline, and these changes will be reflected in an export.

					 - The sheet owner and shared collaborators with Admin access can further configure and customize the Gantt chart's Primary and Secondary Headers by modifying the Timeline Display found in the sheet's [Project Settings](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/765755#timelinedisplay).

			 - [[Topic 14]] : [[Calendar View]]
				 - Calendar View is one of the four ways to view your sheet in Smartsheet and provides an interactive and easily customizable view of your work on a calendar. Smartsheet Calendar View also allows to publish or overlay on Google calendar or an iCal in Outlook or Apple calendars.

				 - Just like the other sheet views in Smartsheet, Calendar View is driven by the column types in your sheet. In order to create a Calendar, you must have at least one Date column, and can get more comprehensive with both a start and end date for a task.

				 - **Work with Calendar View**
					 - The Calendar View is a reflection of the dates contained in a sheet or report. Any sheet or report containing at least one date column (more on date columns in our [Column Types](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504619#date) article) can be displayed as a calendar by clicking the **Calendar View** button on the toolbar. You can either insert a new column, setting the column type to **date **or change an existing column's type to **date**.

					 - TIP: Change the format of dates by selecting an appropriate **Language (Country)** in the Personal Settings of your Smartsheet account. Details on how to change this can be found in the [Adjusting Personal Settings](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/796268#profile) article.

				 - Select Dates to Display
					 - The Owner and collaborators with Admin access to a sheet or report can determine which tasks will be displayed in Calendar View.
						 - Switch to Calendar View.

						 - Click the gear icon on the right (below the **Share** button) to display the Calendar Settings form.

						 - ![](https://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/attachments/480029)

						 - From the form, you can make adjustments as desired:
							 - Select a column from the **Display only dates in this column** drop-down list to place each task with a date listed in the column on a single date in the calendar.

							 - Use the **Display date ranges **drop-down list to select two date columns in your sheet. In this case, each task with a date in both columns will be displayed in the calendar extended across the date range. This feature is most helpful when tracking a task from start to finish.

							 - NOTE: If you're working in a [report](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/522214), the Calendar View can reflect dates spread across multiple sheets. Make sure all of the sheets contain column names that exactly match what you've selected in the Calendar Settings. Tasks from sheets that don't contain these columns won't appear in the calendar as expected.

							 - 

							 - If you've set up [row hierarchy](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/504734) in your sheet, you can choose whether to **Display Summary Tasks**. Uncheck this option to hide the top-level parent row and only display sub-tasks in the Calendar View.

							 - NOTE: This will remove the summary tasks from the Smartsheet calendar view, but not from the version published to Google or iCal. As row hierarchy doesn't appear in the Grid View of a report, the option to **Display Summary Tasks** isn't available in the Calendar View of a [report](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/522214).

							 - 

							 - Select **Display My Reminders** to display a reminder icon (a bell) on each day in the calendar that a [reminder](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/542913) is scheduled to be sent to you. All sheet collaborators have the option to display their own reminders.

							 - NOTE: Reminders can't be created from a report, so **Display My Reminders** isn't available in the Calendar View of a [report](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/522214).

					 - Each bar in the calendar will display the text from the [Primary Column](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/504645) of the sheet or report. When parent rows are expanded in a sheet, bar colors for child rows can be set by right-clicking (PC) or Ctrl+clicking (Mac) on the bar and selecting **Color Settings**. Additional information can be found in our [Changing the Color of Calendar Bars](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/516441) help article.

					 - TIP: If you don't want to see all tasks appear in the calendar, create a new date column (i.e. 'Calendar Date') in [Grid View](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/765715). Only place dates in this column if you want the task to appear in the calendar. Switch back to Calendar View and select your new date column in the **Calendar Settings** form.

					 - At this time there isn't a way to schedule a task to take place at a certain time, only a certain date. Project sheet tasks with duration in partial days, hours, or minutes will still span across full days in the Calendar View, as well as in any published versions of the calendar.

				 - Edit Row Information
					 - The sheet Owner, and collaborators with either Admin or Editor access can change the date for a task by dragging the bar and dropping it on a new day. Tasks that span a start and end date can be dragged from the left or right edge to extend their duration.

					 - NOTE: The drag functionality is not available in a report's Calendar View, or for parent rows (any row with sub-tasks indented underneath) in a sheet if [dependencies](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/765727) are enabled.

					 - You can edit rows from the **Calendar View** by double-clicking on the calendar bar. The **Edit Row **form appears, enabling you to edit all cells in the row. Changes made here will be reflected in the [Grid View](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/765715).

				 - Change the Calendar Timeframe
					 - To change the time frame in **Calendar View**, click the right or left arrow at the top to move forward or backward in time. Click the drop-down to change the units of time.

					 - ![](https://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/attachments/83311)

					 - Clicking on the mini-calendar will also allow you to navigate through your project by dates.

					 - Once you’ve configured your Calendar View you can either [Print the calendar to PDF](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/809566), [Publish](http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/775707) it to an external calendar program, or send it to a recipient via email by clicking **File** > **Send as Attachment.**

					 - NOTE:** **When you print a Calendar, it will always print 4 weeks of calendar information per page, and there is not a way to adjust the size of the boxes.

			 - [[Topic 15]] : [[Mobile App]]
				 - The Smartsheet mobile app for iOS and Android allows you real-time access to your Smartsheet data, wherever you are. Whether you're in a meeting or on the go, you can easily update information in the editable grid, track real-time progress on dashboards, and fill out forms to collect data. You can also add photos from your smartphone, view attachments, take action on alerts, scan barcodes, update requests, and submit approvals.

				 - **Differences between the desktop and mobile apps**
					 - With the Smartsheet mobile apps for iOS and Android, you can view and take action on your work while on the go.

					 - Capabilities unique to the mobile apps
						 - There are many similarities between the mobile and desktop apps, and there are some capabilities that you can only take advantage of from the mobile apps. These include:
							 - Using your GPS to enter your location into a sheet or form field

							 - Taking a photo with your device, editing it, and uploading it directly to a sheet or form submission

							 - Scanning a barcode or QR code to update or search for sheet data

							 - Accessing your forms quickly from the **Home **or **Recents **screen

						 - With the above features in mind, you can create processes for your team members that work on the go or in the field. For example, your construction team can upload photos of their progress along with a link to their location, or your IT team can use the barcode scanner to take inventory of hardware and other office supplies.

						 - See the respective [iOS](https://help.smartsheet.com/topics/smartsheet-for-ios) and [Android](https://help.smartsheet.com/topics/smartsheet-for-android) articles for details on the above capabilities and more.

					 - When to use Smartsheet on your desktop
						 - Although the mobile app is robust, there are some limitations. Use the desktop app if you want to do any of the following:
							 - Build [automated workflows](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2476191)

							 - Create and edit [sheet filters](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504659) (once filters have been created on a sheet from your desktop, you can toggle them on and off in the mobile app).

							 - [Manage your users](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2481889) or plan information

							 - Manage [project settings](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/765727) in a sheet

							 - Create and [edit dashboards](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/518547)

						 - Create new reports or [edit the report builder](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/522214) (once configured, you can edit data in a report from the mobile app)

		 - [[Level 2: Intermediate Users]]
			 - Smartsheet allows you to automate and track work processes in real-time so that everyone can be more productive. In this learning track, you'll learn how to easily collect data using forms, track and view activity in your sheet, and custom sort and filter views. You'll also learn how to automate workflows and take action using alerts, reminders, update requests, approvals and more. Finally, you'll review best practices for when to use cell linking and reporting to surface data across multiple sheets to answer key business questions.

			 - [[Topic 1 : Forms]]
				 - Smartsheet forms make it fast and easy to collect and act on data from anyone.

				 - Build your custom form and add [conditional logic](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2481701-use-conditional-logic-to-streamline-form-submissions) to ensure the questions are relevant for each person who’ll fill it out. Then share the form so colleagues, contractors, clients, and others can easily submit information and files from their desktop and mobile devices, wherever they're located.

				 - Collect consistent, error-free data from all of your stakeholders and save it directly into your sheet where you can take action. Forms are ideal for field ticket collection, request management, event registration, collecting customer feedback, and more

				 - **Collect Information with a Form**
					 - Create and share forms to gather and organize information within Smartsheet. After you create and share a form, each form submission will be added to the top or bottom of your sheet as a new row.

					 - Use a form, for example, to collect survey responses, intake project requests, or gather product orders.

					 - Anyone who can access the form can use it to submit information to the sheet.

				 - Create a New Form
					 - Open the sheet that you want to attach the form to.

					 - On the top left of the sheet, click **Forms **>** Create Form**.

					 - When a new form is created, all columns (except for System columns) from your sheet will automatically be added to your form. Each field will function similarly to its respective column type.

					 - For Contact Lists and Dropdown Lists, this includes the **Restrict to list values only **checkbox. When this box is checked, people submitting on the form can only select from values listed in the column values.

					 - See [Use the Best Column Type for Your Data](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/504619) for more information about each column type.

					 - By default, the title of the form corresponds to the sheet name and the fields on the form correspond to the names of their associated sheet columns.

					 - ![Form Builder](https://help.smartsheet.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/2_Form%20Builder.png)

					 - Select an element from the center form preview to edit its settings, displayed in the right panel. For more information about field settings, see [Edit or Remove Fields in a Form](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2481826).

					 - Use **Settings **at the top of the form builder to adjust any form-level settings. For more information, see [Manage Form Display and Submission Options](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/2481836).

					 - When you’ve finished setting up your form, select **Save** at the top-right to save your changes.

				 - Preview and See How to Share the Form
					 - Select **Open Form** to preview the form to ensure it’s configured correctly.

					 - After you've previewed the form, you can close the browser tab that it opens in.

					 - Select **Share Form** to email the form directly from Smartsheet, copy the form link, or embed it in a dashboard or webpage.

					 - Select the back arrow in the top-left corner of the form editor to close it and return to the sheet.

					 - The name of the form you’ve created will appear in the Form Manager where you can distribute the form, view its properties, and more.

					 - Once you share a form, people will be able to use it to add information to your sheet. Each form submission will appear as a new row.

	 - [[Learn JavaScript]]
		 - [[Introduction to javaSript]]
			 - [[What is JavaScript]]
				 - Since JavaScript remains at the core of web development, it’s often the first language learned by self-taught coders eager to learn and build. We’re excited for what you’ll be able to create with the JavaScript foundation you gain here. JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on most websites, including this one.

			 - [[Console]]
				 - The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers. Much of the work the computer does with our code is invisible to us by default. If we want to see things appear on our screen, we can print, or __log__, to our console directly.

				 - the **console** keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, that we can use in our code.

				 - **Keywords** are words that are built into the JavaScript language, so the computer will recognize them and treats them specially.

				 - One **method**, that is built into the console object is the .log() method. When we write console.log() what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.

				 - 

			 - [[Comments]]
				 - it’s often useful to leave notes in our code for other developers or ourselves.

				 - As we write JavaScript, we can write comments in our code that the computer will ignore as our program runs. These comments exist just for human readers.

				 - Comments can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for developers using the code, or add any other useful annotations.

				 - There are two types of code comments in JavaScript:
					 - A __single line comment__ will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding it.

					 - A __multi-line comment__ will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment.

				 - 

			 - [[Data Types]]
				 - __Data types__ are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming. In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:
					 - __Number__: Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.

					 - __String__: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ". Though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.

					 - __Boolean__: This data type only has two possible values— either true or false (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.

					 - __Null__: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null (without quotes).

					 - __Undefined__: This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null.

					 - __Symbol__: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.

					 - __Object__: Collections of related data.

					 - The first 6 of those types are considered __primitive data types__. They are the most basic data types in the language. __Objects__ are more complex, and you’ll learn much more about them as you progress through JavaScript. At first, seven types may not seem like that many, but soon you’ll observe the world opens with possibilities once you start leveraging each one. As you learn more about objects, you’ll be able to create complex collections of data.

			 - [[Arithmetic Operators]]

			 - An __operator__ is a character that performs a task in our code. JavaScript has several built-in __arithmetic operators__, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols:
				 - Add: +

				 - Subtract: -

				 - Multiply: *

				 - Divide: /

				 - Remainder: %
