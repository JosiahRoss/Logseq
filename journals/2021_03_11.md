	 - **methodology for saving and systematically reminding** us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections

	 - You’ll have an ongoing record of personal discoveries, lessons learned, and **actionable insights for any situation.**

	 - **Consistently move your projects and goals to completion** by organizing and accessing your knowledge in a results-oriented way

	 - **Transform your personal knowledge into income**, taking advantage of a rapidly growing knowledge economy

	 - **Uncover** **unexpected patterns and connections** between ideas

	 - **Reduce stress and “information overload”** by expertly curating and managing your personal information stream

	 - **Develop valuable expertise, specialized knowledge, and the skills** to deploy it in a new job, career, or business

	 - **Cultivate a collection of valuable knowledge** and insights over time without having to follow rigid, time-consuming rules

	 - **Unlock the full value of the wealth of learning resources all around you**, such as online courses, webinars, books, articles, forums, and podcasts

	 - **Remember**
		 - What are the recurring themes and questions that I always seem to return to in my work and life?

		 - What insightful, high-value, impactful information do I already have access to that could be valuable?

		 - Which knowledge do I want to interconnect, mix and match, and periodically resurface to stimulate future thinking on these subjects?

		 - Instead of organizing each one of the information management tools you use in a completely different way, use your projects as universal categories across all of them. This helps reduce the fragmentation of your project files, without requiring you to only use one tool for everything.

		 - [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes-3459b257d3eb/) is a technique that relies on summarizing a note in multiple stages over time. You save only the best excerpts from whatever you’re reading, and then create a summary of those excerpts, and then a summary of that summary, distilling the essence of the content at each stage. These “layers” are like a digital map that can be zoomed in or out to any level of detail you need. Progressive Summarization allows you to read the note in different ways for different purposes: in depth if you want to glean every detail, or at a high level if you just need the main takeaway. This allows you to review a note’s contents in seconds to decide if it’s useful for the task at hand.
