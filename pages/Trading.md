- [[Joe Bankmann]] sent me a book to read about Stock trading 
	 - >Hey, this info can seem like it applies to day trading/short term trading only, but it can apply to mid term trading too, and a bit to "investing" also.  I'm almost all the way through and it's extremely helpful. Another good book is "Trading in the Zone" by Mark Douglas.  This is more about the psychology of trading.A great podcast is Chat With Traders.  Very down to earth, experiential and strategy focused. A decent "guru" type youtube guy is "ziptrader."  I wouldn't take his techniques as hard-fact but he has a wealth of info, especially on ways to use thinkorswim software, basic entry and exit points (here is where I wouldn't take his info as purely factual), and types of trades to look for.
