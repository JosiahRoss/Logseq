	 - Today will be great if i can just figure out how best to help out the crew, 

	 - it is very strange to not have any real work to do, there is of course so much to do but everything has a fucking comitie and a  2 meeting before anything can even start happeing. that is somthing i need to get used to and i need to be ssettingn up meeting so i can take care of wht i need to in the studio

	 - there is a [[ALDI]] shoot today , that i thought i was going to be on, i will be helping out on with the shoot and all the other shoots that are going on , this feels more like what i am supposed to be doing , helping everyone make the job easier , 

	 - i need to spend a night a week at the studio doing my own work , god  i remeber the last time i tried to do this , i did not do well , my images are boring at best and confused at worse, 
		 - Look into books on photography 

	 - i am not really sure what i should be working tword now, it is very confusing . i have always just worked so i could get paid , and have things that i like , 

	 - but now i feel like , i should be working tword some over all goal , that i dont even know what it could be , what is the next "Move up " for someone in my position 

	 - i am sure things will fall into place shortly ,it is just strange now because idont know how it all works and that is always scary , [[Jordan Balderas]] is killing it , but even he is board , and want to do interesting work , that is the type of work we are not doing but i think it could be , we need to show the value that we bring , i feel like i have brought no value to the studio, other than the sunk cost of training me in thier workflow 

	 -

	 - **Gratitudes**
		 - I am Grateful for.. my children , this beutiful day , a job that i enjoy , a partner that makes me happy ,

	 - Today is the first day that i am trying to use roam as a journaling tool. I am not sure if this will do any better than the last time. This will have to be enough this morning. i think i need to give my self more time.
I am never really sure what to write here , work is going fairly well. i am  definitely in over my head but i am getting the hang of it 

	 - I need to use the time on the train more productively. Input. Output this is the first time I have understood the idea of it.  better Input will on turn produce better Output. then the need is what input and what look Output. books on capture one.    photography design , fuck maybe books on navigating this corporate system.

	 - I am terribly hungover , i went out with [[Jordan Balderas]] last night it was fun, in the end, i really think i dont want to drink to excess any more , the fun is just not there.

	 - we went to Bavettes and guilt bar , it was nice, [[Jordan Balderas]] got super crunk and we had to leave, he was very kind. and very silly.
